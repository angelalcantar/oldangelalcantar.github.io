                        <p>Hello,</p>
			<p>My name is Angel Alcantar, and I am a recent college graduate with a Bachelors of Science in Psychology. 
			I love working with people and learning about them which is why I majored in psychology. 
			I also love technology and have even created this website to show my resume even though I am by no means a programmer. </p>
			<p>I was previously an intern and I worked my way up to be a Quality Assurance Analyst I at a start-up company called 8th Day Software. 
			Part of the skills I learned while working at 8th Day were to design test plans, scenarios, and procedures for both desktop and mobile testing as well as perform regression testing, documenting software defects, using a bug tracking system (JIRA and qTest), and report defects to software developers.
			I frequently worked with managers and software developers to resolve issues and I was never afraid to voice my concerns because of my personal value of providing the best products possible to our clients. All of this was often done with multiple projects at a time. </p>

			<p>My ultimate goal is to provide value to the company that employees me and to their customers while living a life of authenticity. </p>
